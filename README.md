# pytorch-expresso

A high-level framework for PyTorch to quickly set up a training pipeline by using configurable experiments.

# Usage

The framework already depends on torch, torchvision and comet-ml, so that the only requirement would be this project.

# Install

Checkout the sources 

`$> git clone git@github.com:pytorch-expresso.git`

Go to the python environment (preferebly anaconda) you want pytorch-expresso  

`$> conda activate my-conda-env`

Go to the sources directory

`$> cd pytorch-expresso`

Execute the setup script from within the python environment

`$> python setup.py install`

The framework is now available to all projects which share the python environment.

Happy Coding!
